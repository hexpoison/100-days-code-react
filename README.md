# 100 Days of JavaScript Code
This repo tracks my progress and projects for the 100 Days of JavaScript Code challenge. I'll be logging my daily progress and working on various projects ranging from basic syntax to more advanced topics. My goal is to improve my skills and build a portfolio. The log and project directories contain my progress and work respectively.
